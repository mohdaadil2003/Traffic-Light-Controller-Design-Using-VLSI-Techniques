# Traffic-Light-Controller-Design-Using-VLSI-Techniques

Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a Traffic Light Controller using VLSI design principles. The controller manages traffic signals at an intersection, ensuring efficient traffic flow by utilizing a finite state machine (FSM) architecture.

Features
Finite State Machine Implementation: Utilizes an FSM to control traffic light sequences systematically.
Hardware Description Language (HDL): Designed using Verilog/VHDL for modeling and simulation.
Simulation and Testing: Extensively tested through simulation tools to validate performance under various traffic scenarios.
