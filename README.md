# Traffic-Light-Controller-Design-Using-VLSI-Techniques

# Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a Traffic Light Controller using VLSI design principles. The controller manages traffic signals at an intersection, ensuring efficient traffic flow by utilizing a finite state machine (FSM) architecture.

# Features
Finite State Machine Implementation: Utilizes an FSM to control traffic light sequences systematically.
Hardware Description Language (HDL): Designed using Verilog/VHDL for modeling and simulation.
Simulation and Testing: Extensively tested through simulation tools to validate performance under various traffic scenarios.

# Usage
After simulation, the waveform outputs can be analyzed to verify the correct sequence of traffic lights. For FPGA implementation, synthesize the design using your FPGA toolchain and upload it to the target device.
